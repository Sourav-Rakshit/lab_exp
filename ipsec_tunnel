Thanks for sharing the images. Here's a clear explanation of how to **configure IPSec VPN in tunnel mode using Cisco Packet Tracer**, based on your handwritten notes and network topology.

---

## üîê **Objective**

To configure a secure **IPSec VPN tunnel** between two remote networks using Cisco routers in **tunnel mode**. Tunnel mode encrypts both the payload and the original IP header.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Devices Needed**

You need **5 devices**:

* 2 PCs (PC0 - TMSL and PC1 - TIU)
* 2 Routers (Router0 and Router3)
* 1 Intermediate Router (Router1) ‚Äì acting as the internet/public network

---

## üì∂ **Network Topology**

```
PC0 --- Router0 --- Router1 --- Router3 --- PC1
```

IP addressing:

* PC0: 192.168.1.2 / Gateway: 192.168.1.1
* PC1: 192.168.2.2 / Gateway: 192.168.2.1
* Router0 interfaces:

  * Fa0/0: 192.168.1.1
  * Fa0/1: 172.16.1.1
* Router3 interfaces:

  * Fa0/0: 192.168.2.1
  * Fa0/1: 172.16.1.2

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Steps**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assign IPs to all Devices

Set IPs on PCs and routers as per the topology diagram.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Interfaces

Enable interfaces on each router via CLI:

```bash
interface fastEthernet 0/0
 no shutdown
exit

interface fastEthernet 0/1
 no shutdown
exit
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Static Routing

To ensure communication across routers:

* On **Router0**:

  ```bash
  ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.2
  ```
* On **Router3**:

  ```bash
  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1
  ```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ISAKMP (Phase 1)

On **both routers**:

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
 encryption aes
 hash sha
 authentication pre-share
 group 5
 lifetime 86400
exit

crypto isakmp key cisco123 address [peer IP]
```

* On Router0: peer IP = `172.16.1.2`
* On Router3: peer IP = `172.16.1.1`

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ IPSec (Phase 2)

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set VPN-SET esp-aes esp-sha-hmac
 mode tunnel
exit
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Crypto Map

```bash
crypto map VPN-MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer 172.16.1.2
 set transform-set VPN-SET
 match address 100
exit

interface fastEthernet 0/1
 crypto map VPN-MAP
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Access List

```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```

* On Router3, **reverse** the source and destination.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Test Connectivity

On **PC0**, go to Command Prompt and ping:

```bash
ping 192.168.2.2
```

If everything is configured correctly, the ping will succeed and traffic will be encrypted via **IPSec tunnel**.

---

## üì∏ Suggested Screenshots

* Router CLI configurations
* PCs ping results
* Packet Tracer simulation mode showing encrypted traffic (lock symbol on packets)

Let me know if you want the complete CLI configuration script or Packet Tracer `.pkt` file.
